            <p>
                KegTracker is a simple and nimble asset tracking system designed for the Micro and Regional craft brewer.  Our system allows the craft brewer to monitor individual kegs, throughout the supply chain, while collecting critical business data needed to make informed decisions.

        <div>
            <p>
                KegTracker works by collecting information at key points throughout the keg life cycle - like when an asset was filled, delivered, or picked up.  Using this information, we generate detailed reports to illustrate what is actually happening with your kegs.  Depending on your implementation, you can use any combination of these devices to scan your kegs.

                Tracking you kegs is vital for two reasons - protecting the capital investment you’ve made and being able to effectively resource a key manufacturing component.   With KegTracker you will be able to answer important questions like:
                <ul>
                    <li> Where are my kegs and what is in them? </li>
                    <li> How many kegs do I have at the brewery?  in the market?  total?    </li>
                    <li> Which SKUs come back the quickest from each market?    </li>
                    <li> Have I lost any of my kegs?  Who lost my kegs? </li>
                </ul>

                The KegTracker System is a monthly subscription based on how many assets are being tracked per day.  The monthly subscription rate is about $0.04/CE tracked.  So if you have 100 1/6BR Kegs, your monthly rate would be $9.18

        <div>        
            <p>
                You scan a keg each time it goes to a distributor, into the market, is filled, or when it is returned to the brewery.  Using RFID technology eases the scanning process, and in many cases eliminates it.
