		<h1> Keg Tracking by Industry Folk for Industry Folk	</h1>
		<p>
			The CraftNet system is something new and incredible for the Craft Brewer and Keg Leaser.  It gives our industry a simple way to manage a keg float while gathering the critical information needed to make informed business decisions.  
			CraftNet takes complex technologies, like RFID tags and 2D Barcodes, and makes them simple and easy to use.		
		<p>	
			CraftNet brings extremely powerful tools to all sizes and types of Craft Breweries in a scalable and affordable way.  Getting started with the system costs as little as a 2D barcode scanner, an internet connection, and a computer - Mac or PC.
